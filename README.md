# BlazeDDD

This is a repo of the code for https://chestercodes.github.io/BlazeDDD/

It details the DDD events which are coming up and past events.

This is inspired by my wanting to try Blazor and also this tweet - https://twitter.com/craftyfella/status/1018805299568893952

Some initial data is from - https://blog.adrianbanks.co.uk/ddd-grouped.html

### Contributing - data ### 

If you want to add data about DDD events, please look in the data folder and add to one of the json files there. The `Template.json` file details the shape required for adding data.

Once the data is updated one needs to run the `build.ps1` file to update the static site.

### Contributing - style ### 

PRs welcome for making the site look better.
